# Black_jack
In this game we get a set of cards from Ace to king, the values of Ace,jack,queen,king are [11,10,10,10] respectively.
Here we calculate the total sum of the user and the computer in the value of cards, If sum of the user is greater than the sum of the computer then the user wins othewise visa-versa. Here we need to keep a note that the value of the cards must be less than 21 and if there is a 11:Ace in any deck and sum is greater than 21 we can replace 11 with 1.
If the value of cards is greater than 21 for any one then that player, either player or computer will loose.
